　　民工啊，种植高楼的人们。每逢年初，严寒还未消尽，柳枝还未抽芽，你们便背起那苦涩的行囊连同母亲的叮嘱，穿上那件破旧的衣服连同妻子连夜赶做的布鞋起程了。慈母苍老的白发在送行，妻子憔悴的目光在送行，还有那被窝里孩子甜甜的睡意在送行……挥挥手，折过山梁，你们便落泪，为了那间茅草屋不再被秋风卷起，为了寒冬的火炉里多一块煤炭，为了给母亲带来一颗他乡的桔子，为了给孩子捎来一颗城市的糖粒……走过黄土地的双脚又要走在水泥地上，种植庄稼的双手再去种植高楼，等着你们的将是繁华的都市、沙石、钢铁，还有那肮脏的怒斥和鄙夷的目光……山路在脚下延伸，远远地再望一眼故乡，故乡啊，为了生活，路还很长。
　　行至关前，进得城门，尤其注意了地面的巨大青石，马蹄踩的多了，形成了深浅不一的石坑，表面光滑，多集中在中间。抬头一看，拱门也是大青石构成，多少年了，其无一挤出或破裂。第二道拱门里侧，有一处“雁鸣石”，传说关隘过高，以致阻挡了北雁南飞的途程，大雁无奈，只好以身相抗。这些石头的堆积，都把可爱的燕子逼得撞墙而死，在燕子之下，已不知埋葬了多少人和动物的尸骨！？我拣石敲之许久，未有“雁鸣”之声传出。倒是城头上的弓弩，箭杆结实，头部尖锐，呼啸之间，就击穿了百步之遥稻草人的咽喉和胸肩。
　　我是迟迟、痴痴的不懂痴情的。我没有经历过，尽管希望有。可是我像一个病了很久的孩子一样，忘记了长大，好奇，像一个屠夫一样，痴迷的愿意探究一些深处的东西，像解剖自己一样解剖别人，然后满足与自己的解剖，也许是求得一种人生的丰富或者经历。你必须知道这点，进入一些人的内心，否则你不能懂我说的痴情。
In the plateau sunshine; the annihilation of the footprints of part of the temple and the reconstruction, from which we have seen, in the long history of Dali people to create such a brilliant culture of piety and full of enthusiasm.
The reason is: "at the beginning of the day as big as a hood.
And Japan, such as plate jar, this not as far is small and near big?"
To this question, I think for a long time, always did not want to understand.
A New Year's day to go home, drinking, one village college students, and ask him.
And he said, whether in the morning or at noon, the sun actually are.
Only when the sun rises in the morning, near the horizon of the mountains, trees, houses, these "little things" became the foil of the sun, the sun appears outstanding, looks big;
By noon, the sun high up in the air, foil around lost, lonely, look is small.
That night, I for a long time did not sleep, think a lot.
My hometown is JieQu bright moon, my story is surrounded by willow creek, the moon is a CongYing, river is a dream, a hazy, the life of the full moon in water is still a sunrise and make, sunrise and interest rates, is the sound of nights, chanticleer in the morning is the several loud bark, midnight in the deep, physical, joys and sorrows, flood rain or shine, their family, they are really belong to me, make me calm, let me at ease, I am a standing in this piece of heaven and earth "person".
What city, an extension of the city is my material, is a delicate embroidery, I can not hand knead fine fine creamy silk thread, I am not the girl embroidered, countryside, I was the wind, the wind is cannot leave the field.
I under buildings, can only be huddled small residue.
Four grandpa said: cows are eating grass on the grassland, the cow is very small;
Cattle into the circle, the cow is very large.
That's because in the background.
